## SessionManager.transfer() method

Transfer.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
transfer(session: Session, target: Session | string, options?: SessionReferOptions): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  session | Session | Session with the transferee to transfer. |
|  target | Session \| string | The referral target. |
|  options | SessionReferOptions |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

## Remarks

If target is a Session this is an attended transfer completion (REFER with Replaces), otherwise this is a blind transfer (REFER). Attempting an attended transfer completion on a call that has not been answered will be rejected. To implement an attended transfer with early completion, hangup the call with the target and execute a blind transfer to the target.
